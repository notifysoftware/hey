# Notify
Hello ðŸ‘‹. We're Notify's software development team, allow us to introduce ourselves.

We are a Premium Discord Cook Group but we won't get into that too much here. If you're interested, check out [our website](https://notify.org) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/notify).


#### So, what's this GitHub organisation?
As we've so many developers working on Notify, it has became increasingly hard to manage code across multiple people and accounts. Additionally there will be some open source extras under the Notify name here. Keep your eyes out.
